## Getting started 
### First time
Make sure it is installed `NODE JS` and `NPM` in your system, the execute this command :
```
npm install
```

### Watching
```
npm run start
```

### Details 
All you need to do only in `*.pug` , `partials/*.pug`, `less/*.less` and `less/partials/*.less`. 
We are using `Gulp` as `pug` and `less` compilers, and all run asynchronously using `browser-sync`.

`.pug` files will be compiled into a directory `_site` and `.less` to the directory `_site/css`.
